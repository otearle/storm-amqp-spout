/**
 * Declares a named, durable queue and binds it to an existing exchange.  This
 * is a good choice for production use as the queue will survive spout
 * restarts, so you won't miss messages if your spout crashes.
 *
 * <p><strong>N.B.</strong> this could be risky under some circumstances. e.g.
 * if while prototyping you set a development topology consuming from a
 * production AMQP server, then kill your topology and go home for the night;
 * messages will continue to be queued up, which could threaten the stability
 * of the AMQP server if the exchange is high-volume.  For prototyping consider
 * {@link ExclusiveQueueWithBinding}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This queue is safe for multiple parallel spout tasks: as they all consume
 * the same named queue, the AMQP broker will round-robin messages between
 * them, so each message will get processed only once (barring redelivery due
 * to outages).</p>
